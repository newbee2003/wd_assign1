            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>
              Photography has been always a part of my life. However, my life as
              a photographer only started when I started grade 10 and joined the
              Photography club in my high school.<br /><br />Taking pictures is
              not only fun, but it also helps you to see closer to details that
              you normally forgot: the light, the expressions of people, etc.

            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>
              Many people would think that your job can't be your hobby.<br /><br />
              However, to me, that sentence is completely wrong. I chose to
              study programming to make it into a career and I still find joy in
              coding. Of course, coding can be hard and frustrated at the time,
              but the feeling of finishing a project or a product is
              priceless.<br /><br />
              As a person who majored in Maths, I enjoy solving problems,
              however, Maths can be unrealistic. To me, programming is using
              Maths, using logic to solve problems in the world.

            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>
              Books are knowledge that is given to us by our ancestors. Some of
              you may say that fictional books can not give you knowledge.<br /><br />However,
              every book has its own purpose from teaching to telling us the
              story from the author's eyes. Understanding new things are
              important but you can not forget about learning about human.<br /><br />Seeing
              the world from other people's eyes can help enrich your point of
              view and help you grow further as a person.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will share with you one of my favourite books:
              <strong><i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i></strong
              >. This may be not the most meaningful book, and Edmon Dantes is
              not the best character. However, to me, that is the story that I
              enjoy, and make me curious about the world. What has the author
              been through or seen to create a fictional world that cruel and
              detailed?

            <h2>Listening to Music</h2>
            <p>
              Listening to music is probably has a different meaning to every
              person. Some may find music to be the thing that helps them during
              hardship. Some may only listen to music for relaxation. Others may
              listen to Mozart to improve their efficiency in learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am the second type. Listening to music brings me joy and just
              like books, music can show you the musician's point of view. I
              enjoy the complexity of classical music though I am still not good
              enough to fully understand them. My favourite music change from
              day to day so currently I mostly listen to Japanese music
              especially from Yoasobi. Some of his works that I enjoy are:
