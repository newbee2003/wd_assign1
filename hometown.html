              Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is a wonderful city with good food
              and people.<br /><br />Vietnam has been a popular place for
              tourism, however, the image of its people toward foreigners are
              not that good because of the scammers. Though these two photos are
              a small aspect of the people in Hanoi I want to change the existed
              image about Vietnamese in some people by art.<br /><br />The
              beautiful drawing from an old artist. This kind of drawing has
              always been a part of the culture around Guom Lake in Hanoi.<br /><br />Another
              group is a small band that was playing on Guom Lake. Though the
              song may only reach a small number of people at the time and it
              had indeed lightened up the mood around that area.

            <h2>The Scenery</h2>
            <p>
              Hanoi has a lot of beautiful scenery but the most popular one is
              probably Guom Lake.<br /><br />The photo on the left may be only a
              tiny view of a gigantic lake, but it has already shown us the
              beauty of it. The green tree alongside is blue sky and water -
              such an impressive view.
